    <p>
        The English Training Interactive LLC (ETI) was founded with awareness of the necessity and utility of English as a lingua franca in the modern world, 
        and with desire to contribute to the education of a workforce capable of wielding English with fluidity and precision. To that end, we the organization 
        exist to provide lessons, tools, and effective resources to secondary students, who are most primed to learn the intricacies of the language. We believe 
        that our organization offers something others do not: An evidence-based, gamified curriculum that presents the minutiae of English in an easily digested, 
        long lasting format ideal to modern, technology enabled students.
